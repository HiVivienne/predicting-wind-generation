# Improving Predictability of Wind Power Generation

This repo contains  code and data used in my thesis submitted in 2023 (https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/150204)

Abstract:
Wind energy plays an important role in decarbonizing the economy and increasingly
accounts for a growing share of electricity supply in the United States. However,
availability of wind resource is highly dependent on variable factors such as weather
and local geographies, making wind power generation forecast a particularly difficult
task. This adds to the challenge of grid management, which requires that the supply
of electricity equates the demand at all times.

Complicating the effort to improve wind power predicitability is a lack of em-
pirical data, since wind power generation data are proprietary and often considered

business secrets. To address this lack of empirical study, this thesis uses actual gen-
eration data between 2016 to 2021 from seven anonymized wind farms in Midwestern

United States that range from 50MW to 235MW in size. The experiments demon-
strate how machine learning methods can be used to forecast wind power generation

at different time intervals, and how the accuracy of forecasting can be significantly
improved when using a combination of newly extracted weather forecast data and
weather measurement data. The economic benefits of more accurate forecasting are

then studied using a using a simulation with market data from the Midcontinent In-
dependent System Operator and the Southwest Power Pool. The thesis then explores

whether predictability of wind power generation can be improved by placing weather
stations closer to the wind forecast sites. Implications of these findings can inform
investment decisions regarding weather monitoring stations and forecasting models,
which can help electricity market participants adapt to a grid with an increasing share
of renewable resources.
